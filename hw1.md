Homework 1: Machine Learning Main Ideas
================

1.Supervised learning involves building a model based on inputs when you
know what the output (response variable Y) is and adjusting your model
to best predict or estimate that output. Unsupervised learning, on the
other hand, has observed inputs, but no observed outputs (i.e.Â they do
not have a supervisor) and rely on finding trends in the inputted data
(page 26-27 in An Introduction to Statistical Learning and Lecture
One).  
2. The difference between a regression and classification model involves
the response variable Y and whether it is quantitative or qualitative
(Lecture One). In the context of machine learning, this means we are
either predicting a numerical or categorical value, regardless whether
the inputs are qualitative or quantitative.
